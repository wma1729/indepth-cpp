A few things stand out from this table:
- `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char` are all treated as separate data types. Is the *char* signed or unsigned? It depends on the platform. On both of the systems above, char is signed.
- Both `signed` and `unsigned`, without further qualifications, resolve to 4-byte `int`.
- On Windows, `long` is 4-bytes even on 64-bit platform.
