# Integer Types

C++ offers various integer types. These vary based on their size, sign, and purpose. The following output is generated by [integer](integer.cpp) on 64-bit Linux and 64-bit Windows system.

A few things stand out from this table:
- `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char` are all treated as separate data types. Is the **char** signed or unsigned? It depends on the platform. On both of the systems above, char is signed.
- `short`, `int`, and `long` are always signed. `char` is the odd one out.
- Both `signed` and `unsigned`, without further qualifications, resolve to 4-byte integer type.
- On Windows, `long` is 4-bytes even on 64-bit platform.

### Negative Number Storage
Negative numbers are stored as 2's complement, which is 1's complement + 1.
Number | Binary Representation | 1's complement | 2's complement
-------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------
0      | 0000 0000             | 1111 1111      | 0000 0000
1      | 0000 0001             | 1111 1110      | 1111 1111
2      | 0000 0010             | 1111 0010      | 1111 0011
126    | 0111 1110             | 1000 0001      | 1000 0010
127    | 0111 1111             | 1000 0000      | 1000 0001

### Casting
Casting up an integer number, I<sub>small</sub>, to a bigger integer data type is safe as along as I<sub>small</sub> is not negative.
```C++
short s = -1;             // s = 0xffff
unsigned int i = s;       // i = 0xffff ffff
```

This is usually not that bad as most programmers understand such nuances. Problems arise when the compiler does an auto upcast.
```C++
#include <iostream>

int
main()
{
        short           s = -1;
        unsigned int    i = 1;

        /*
         * One side of the comparison is short and the other side is unsigned int.
         * The comiler auto upgrades s to unsigned int. This makes s bigger than i.
         * An easy to miss comparison.
         */
        if (s > i)
                std::cout << "Surprise!!!" << std::endl;
        else
                std::cout << "Liar!" << std::endl;

        return 0;
}
```

Casting down an integer number to a smaller integer data type is dangerous and can lead to loss of information. You will see tons of code around where downcast is seen. In those cases, the programmers are usually aware of the possible values that the variables can hold.

### Shift Operators
The behavior of shift operators on negative numbers is undefined.

### When to use signed/unsigned data types.
Use unsigned types when dealing with flags/bitmaps where the values are primarily set/checked/cleared using bitwise operator. They are often very useful when programming lower level system programming like interaction with hardware device, low level protocol management, etc. especially when the extra bit can be the life-saver. For all other needs rely on signed data types.

### stdint.h/cstdint
Avoid the urge to define your own integer types like
```C++
typedef short           int16;
typedef unsigned short  uint16;
typedef int             int32;
typedef unsigned int    uint32;
```
If having the size embedded in the type name is comforting to you, look at stdint.h or its C++ sibling cstdint. Many such types are already pre-defined there.

### My 2 cents on unsignedness of size_t
Hate it! It lead to the creation of ssize_t (signed size_t).  I am aware of most arguments in favor of it. From my experience, it leads to useless type-casting and in some cases prevent natural programming flow.
