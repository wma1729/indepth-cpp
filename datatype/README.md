# Integer Types

C++ offers various integer types. These vary based on their size, sign, and purpose. The following output is generated by [integer](integer.cpp) on 64-bit Linux and 64-bit Windows system.

A few things stand out from this table:
- `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char` are all treated as separate data types. Is char signed or unsigned? It depends on the platform. On both of the systems above, char is signed.
- Both `signed` and `unsigned` without further qualifications resolve to 4-byte `int`.
- On Windows, `long` is 4-bytes even on 64-bit platform.
